# asciigame
**This repository is a placeholder. Contained is v0.1 of ASCIIGAME.**

The functions here were used in my first ASCII-based games, and are simply references.

ASCIIGAME is currently being developed into a much bigger library, which utilizes object oriented C. **Not** Objective-C, just some hacks that makes C object-oriented.
